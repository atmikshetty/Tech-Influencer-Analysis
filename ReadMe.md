# Twitter Mini-Dashboard 

The data collected for the project is from the 'Ntscraper'. The tool is going to be dead soon, so not much data could be collected. But the data collected for each influencer is of the same ratio.


## Run the code

The code files and the datasets scraped are saved in the repo.
A link to the Google Colab file is also attached. Feel free to play around with it.
The outputs are also available, feel free to re-run or modify them.
