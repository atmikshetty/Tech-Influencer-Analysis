Imagine you're working on a project with a team using different computers—Windows, Mac, Linux. Normally, this causes problems because software might work on one computer but not on another due to different setups.  Docker solves this by packaging your app in a neat container with everything it needs—code, libraries, tools. This way, it runs the same on any computer.  In production, Docker ensures your app runs consistently, scales easily, and deploys quickly. Containers prevent conflicts, use fewer resources than VMs, save costs, and boost performance, making production more reliable and efficient.  #techWithStriver #striver",@striver_79,"May 18, 2024 · 5:25 AM UTC",693,18,25

Other use cases could be cost management and resource consumption (usually applicable to early startups/personal projects)   You can block requests beyond a number every minute or so, this is the easiest implementation.

Most freshers or new engineers miss out on caching of images when they build a project.   Rather than fetching images directly from cloud storage(let’s say S3 in AWS or GCS in GCP), try caching them using cloudfront in AWS of CDN in GCP.   Note: if you update the file on your storage, make sure to invalidate cloudfront/cdn or else it will still serve the old content.
